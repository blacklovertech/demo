<h1>Transfer File Between Two VirtualBox Ubuntu Machines</h1>

<h2>Step 1: Create VM-1 and VM-2</h2>
<p>Create two VirtualBox Ubuntu VMs named "VM-1" and "VM-2" with suitable configurations.</p>

<h2>Step 2: Start VM-1 and VM-2</h2>
<p>Start both VM-1 and VM-2 in VirtualBox.</p>

<h2>Step 3: Configure Networking</h2>
<p>Ensure both VMs are using the same network mode in VirtualBox settings. You can choose either "NAT Network" or "Bridged Adapter".</p>

<h2>Step 4: Obtain IP Addresses</h2>
<p>In VM-1, open a terminal and run:</p>
<code>ip addr show</code>
<p>Note down the IP address of VM-1. Repeat the same process in VM-2 to obtain its IP address.</p>

<h2>Step 5: Transfer File from VM-1 to VM-2</h2>
<p>Assuming you have a file named "example.txt" on VM-1 that you want to transfer to VM-2:</p>
<code>scp /path/to/example.txt username@VM2_IP:/path/to/destination</code>
<p>Replace <code>/path/to/example.txt</code> with the path to the file on VM-1, <code>username</code> with your username on VM-2, <code>VM2_IP</code> with the IP address of VM-2, and <code>/path/to/destination</code> with the desired destination path on VM-2.</p>

<p>After executing the command, you will be prompted to enter the password for your username on VM-2.</p>

<h2>Step 6: Verify File Transfer</h2>
<p>Once the transfer is complete, log in to VM-2 and navigate to the destination directory to verify that the file has been successfully transferred.</p>

<p>With these steps, you should have successfully transferred a file from VM-1 to VM-2.</p>
